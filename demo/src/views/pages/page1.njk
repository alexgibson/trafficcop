                The first thing that goes through a captain's head when he hears
                there's low morale goin' around is: "What'd I do? Is it all my
                fault? "Well, he's probably right. Most of us have been together
                a long time. There are others that were here before that. Do you
                all not like me anymore? I mean, what am I supposed to do? I
                don't know. Look, if you're not against me&hellip;don't cross
                this line. If yes, do. I love you all.
