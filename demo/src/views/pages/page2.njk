                What are you gonna spend your money on, kids?
                <br><br>
                Thereâ€™s a special on tacos down at the Taco Mat &mdash; hundred
                tacos for $100 &mdash; Iâ€™m gonna get that.
                <br><br>
                Iâ€™m gonna contribute my money to the Corporation for Public
                Broadcasting.
                <br><br>
                Tacos? Public broadcasting? I wonâ€™t have you kids throwing away
                your money like that. Youâ€™re both coming downtown with me, and
                youâ€™re gonna put that money in the bank.
                <br><br>
                Boy, I sure could go for 100 tacos right about now.
                <br><br>
                No.
